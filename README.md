1. Data scraping is done in python using GitHub API and HTTP requests. A GitHub TOKEN was generated and connection was authorized for fetching the data of all the users in city of Toronto having more than 100 followers. Repositories of these users were fetched. This data was stored as a csv file using pandas library in python.
2. Out of 681 users fetched, it was observed that some users worked for multiple companies.
   Users having longer bios are observed to have more followers. Very weak correlation between Number of public Repositories and Number of followers was observed.
3. Developers having less number of followers can put efforts in writing in-detailed bios to get more followers.
